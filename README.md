# best-office-location-app

## App requirements

1. This is a personal assistant app provided by an international company where Jamie is working.
2. In this app you can see only 3 directions - Amsterdam, Madrid, Budapest (you can easily add a new city if you want).
3. We donâ€™t know what kind of weather Jamie likes and what is a perfect weather for her. So we will leave this choice on her. We provide all information so Jamie can compare and make decisions.
4. On the homepage you can see 3 cities. By clicking on each city you will be redirecting to the Personal City Page with all information:
   - Weather. You can see current weather (temperature, short description) and 5 days forecast.
   - Flights. All you need is just to pick the range in the calendar and you will see cheapest flights from the current city with durations, dates and departure city.
5. After all with this information you can make your choice!
